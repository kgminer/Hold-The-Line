This sprint we were able to finish all of the other features that we wanted to add into the game. There were some user stories that were ultimately cut from the finished product, such as some of the powerups. This was more because we decided that these were not features that we wanted to add to the game rather than we didn't have enough time to implement them. We also came up with some new features to implement such as sound effects and the ability to have two different methods to play the game, top-down or splitscreen. While we are happy with our work there are still other things that we feel could be done on the game to improve it in the future. For example, right now all of the powerups show up in the game in the same way. While they all function properly as defined by our user stories, it is impossible to differentiate one powerup from another. This is something that would be further iterated on if we were to work on the project further.
